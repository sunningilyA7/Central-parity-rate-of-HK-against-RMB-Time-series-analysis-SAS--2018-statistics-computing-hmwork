## BackGround
Since 2018, the exchange rate of the US dollar against the Hong Kong dollar has hit the weak side exchange guarantee of 7.85, and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority has entered the market for the first time in 13 years to buy Hong Kong dollars. Afterwards, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority conducted a total of 13 foreign exchange interventions, selling US dollars in the foreign exchange market and buying around 51 billion Hong Kong dollars to maintain the linked exchange rate. The recent weakening of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate has repeatedly touched upon weak side guarantees and the intervention of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority in the market. This is a normal phenomenon for Hong Kong to follow the United States into the process of substantial interest rate hikes in the context of the current US dollar interest rate hike, and does not mean that the Hong Kong linked exchange rate system will change.

This article first analyzes the data of Hong Kong dollar against Chinese yuan through descriptive statistics, specifically screens the data, studies the data characteristics of this variable, and observes the skewness and kurtosis of the data; Secondly, the future trend of the Hong Kong dollar against the Chinese yuan will be analyzed through time series analysis. Two months after the completion of this article, the advantages and disadvantages of using time series analysis methods will be analyzed by comparing the real trend of the Hong Kong dollar against the Chinese yuan; Finally, obtain specific results and attempt to explore the most suitable interest rate tool for # hedging # against the Hong Kong dollar against the Chinese yuan.
